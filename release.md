# Netmaker v0.18.3

## **Wait till out of pre-release to fully upgrade**

## whats new
- Forced node deletions, if a host doesn't not receive message to delete a node, you can forcefully remove it by deleting it twice from UI/CLI  
  - Allows user to remove orpahned Nodes + Hosts easier
- EMQX ACLs, if using EMQX as broker, ACLs per host will be created, enhancing security around messages
- You can now create ext clients with your own public key, but this feature will not be represented on current UI (new UI on the horizon)
- STUN is now represented as a list including your NM server + 2 we are hosting + 2 of googles (clients will only use 2) for better NAT detection
  - you specify which STUN servers to use with STUN_LIST env variable
